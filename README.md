# Email to Trello

At school, towards the end of class, my teachers will rattle off all the homework that we have to complete. I use Trello to keep track of assignments, due dates, how complete they are, and so on. Unfortunately, adding a description in the Trello website requires creating a card and clicking on it first. By the time that I have done so, my teachers will already have moved on to describing the next assignment.



Fortunately, Trello allows users to send emails to a specific email address to create cards. Unfortunately, I do not wish use a local email client. So, I created this application that allows you to quickly add a description to the card as well.

# Usage

Set your email, password, SMTP server URL, and email to send to under Edit -> Preferences.
